	  <span class="content">Photography is my hobby and I am engineer by profession. I always had the passion for Science and Mathematics, so I chose
	    being an engineer. During my college days I participated and won many National/International level Robotics and Programming Competitions.
	    After completing my graduation from Vishwakarma Institiute of Technology (Pune), I joined a startup named
	    <a href="http://www.azingo.com/">Azingo</a> where I learned many things.
	    I realised true power of Open Source and worked on Linux. I worked on U-boot bootloader, Device Drivers, BSPs, WiFi and GPS in Azingo
	    I can proudly say that working in <a href="http://www.azingo.com/">Azingo</a> has been a milestone in my life.
	    Later I worked in Motorola for 2 months and in Cisco for 10 months. I worked in "Enhanced Charging" in UMTS/LTE network.
	    After working in big organisations I realized, I enjoy working in a startup environment.
	    So I left my comfortable job at Cisco and joined <a href="http://www.infinitelybeta.com/">Infinitely Beta</a>.
	    At <a href="http://www.infinitelybeta.com/">Infinitely Beta</a> We apply great technology to deliver very simple and usable product experiences

	    I like to open-source my interesting work, Do checkout my github profile:

	  <span class="content">In December 2008 I had the privilege of using Nikon D60 for 3 hours. I had no clue that this short stint with
	    DSLR would immediately hook me to photography and make it a passion for lifetime. The magic of experiencing the world from behind
	    a pair of lenses completely amazed me. After that I bought a Canon RebelXs and started clicking pictures.
	    I have come a long way from randomly clicked dark images to neatly composed and processed images, But there is so much more to learn and Quest.
	    In my early days of being a Photographer I learned a lot from
	    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ashw_in/">Ashwin</a> and <a href="http://pixelfactory.co.in/photoblog/index.php?x=browse">Rajith</a>
	    who practically mentored me. After that I started posting my photos on a flickr Group <a href="http://www.photographersatpune.com/">P@P</a>.
	    P@P is really a great group and organises amazing shoots. Now I am an active member of the group and was also part of Drushtikon 2010.
	    I was also one of the photographers who covered a project called "1000 smiles" for Sakal (a regional popular News Media)
